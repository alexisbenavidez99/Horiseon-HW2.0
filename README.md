# Horiseon

## Description

I built this project to help others understand how important SEO can be for any business and how it can help grow your business and even help you save money on advertising! This website helps you understand the importance of SEO and how to utilize it to help your business. It also includes information about social media marketing and cost management. I learned the correct way to name semantic HTML elements, name classes/ids and how to write descriptive alt attributes.
